# Audio Duration

A naive go module to get a audio file's duration in second.

## Usage

```go
import github.com/lizc2003/audioduration
```

For an audio file (eg. `mp3` format)
```go
f, _ := os.Open("audio.mp3")
defer f.Close()
d, err := audioduration.Mp3(f)
if err != nil {
	// handling error
}
```
Or alternatively
```go
f, _ := os.Open("audio.mp3")
defer f.Close()
d, err := audioduration.Duration(f, audioduration.TypeMp3)
if err != nil {
	// handling error
}
```
